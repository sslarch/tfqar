[Tools for Quantitative Archaeology](http://tfqa.com) (TFQA) is a collection of DOS programs developed by Keith Kintigh to perform statistical analyses used in archaeology.
TFQA includes 50 programs and so gives a good representation of the range of analyses used by archaeologists.
The purpose of this document is to track which of these analyses are currently available in R packages.
We hope it will be useful in both porting TFQA-based analyses to R, and in highlighting which methods are not yet implemented in R packages.

The table below presents a list of [TFQA programs](http://tfqa.com/programs.htm) and their equivalent functions in R.
By "equivalent", we mean R functions that provide substantially the same functionality as the original TFQA program with a similar high-level user interface; 
we can assume that all of the analyses listed can be performed in R if the user is prepared to reimplement them themselves. 
The list of R equivalents is also not intended to be exhaustive.
The packages/functions listed are a subjective assessment of the "best" (most complete/widely used/actively maintained) way to get the same results as the TFQA program using R.
See [open-archeo.info](http://open-archaeo.info/) for a general list of archaeology-related R packages.

TFQA is still available and actively maintained.
Some of the more recently added programs are also available as free and open source software (see <https://github.com/kintigh>).
Matt Peeples has also [ported many to R scripts](https://mattpeeples.net/?page_id=656).
This list should therefore be seen as list of alternatives to TFQA (for those who prefer R, open source software, and/or cannot run DOS programs), rather than superseding it.

This is a work-in-progress.
Please feel free to contribute by [editing the table](/sslarch/tfqar/blob/main/tfqar.csv) and submitting a pull request, or [opening an issue](/sslarch/tfqar/issues) with suggestions.
